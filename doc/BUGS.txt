- ktiv haser: the claim is that the system knows how to put nikud for words
	spelled out in ktiv haser but not in ktiv maleh.
- the text that is shown by default on the site is badly punctuated.
	is this because it is punctuated using the system and the system
	simply chooses a puctuation per word by random with no context?
	Maybe we should choose.
- we don't know, in our database, which words are nouns and which are verbs.
- we don't know how to handle prefixes. לשמור, ולשמור
- there are words which are missing.
- the process of preparing the database is not part of our workflow.
