- when I do 'gcloud_deploy.sh' it curretly upload all files (about 30) of the app
	to gcloud. It wasn't always so. There was a gcs bucket that held the previous
	version and only uploaded the diff. How can I get that functionality
	back?
- revamp the user interface to a new clean bright colored and easy on the eyes one.
- add a new page in the site with word bubbles.
	every word will be connected to similar words
	(words close in edit distance).
- add google analytics to track comings and goings to the site.
- all hebrew string should be taken out of the javascript code
	and then the javascript code should be made ascii again and pass js checks.
- fix all pycharm warnings about the code.
- compress the javascript code to make everything run faster.
	or maybe GAE does this automatically? check this.
- make sure that jquery is the compressed version.
- use a new version of jquery.
