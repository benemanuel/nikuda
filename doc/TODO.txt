- google cloud progress:
	- appid is nikuda-web
	- appengine is working.
	- requested to go into the google domain program to get a domain from google
		(nikuda.com).
	- eclipse support is still not there.
	- sql is not there.

- somehow the do_utf_headers var works on marks machine (local install)
	and causes the real site to stop working.
	It is currently enabled for local install and disabled for remote.

- add google analytics to track comings and goings to the site.

- all hebrew string should be taken out of the javascript code
	and then the javascript code should be made ascii again and pass js checks.
- compress the javascript code to make everything run faster.
- make sure that jquery is the compressed version.
- use a new version of jquery.

- diconnect problems in php should give errors and not return the data as part of the code.
- see that these errors are shown to the user.
- make the connect code shared between all the php scripts.
- make the db name and user name be only in one place, easily overridable.

- I want to see errors in communication. at all levels. Log to the console if need be.

- add it so the makefile could dump the database back to a file.
