- stop using unicode directly in nikuda.js. Many text editors and even browsers
	do not know how to display files like these and allow you to comfortably
	edit them. instead put the unicode values (\uXXXX).
	use some tool to do it.
- fix the warning I get about unicode when I do 'gcloud_deploy.sh'.
- when I do 'gcloud_deploy.sh' it curretly upload all files (about 30) of the app
	to gcloud. It wasn't always so. There was a gcs bucket that held the previous
	version and only uploaded the diff. How can I get that functionality
	back?
- revamp the user interface to a new clean bright colored and easy on the eyes one.
- add a new page in the site with word bubbles.
	every word will be connected to similar words
	(words close in edit distance).
- add google analytics to track comings and goings to the site.
- all hebrew string should be taken out of the javascript code
	and then the javascript code should be made ascii again and pass js checks.
- compress the javascript code to make everything run faster.
	or maybe GAE does this automatically? check this.
- compress the css and the html too.
- make sure that jquery is the compressed version.
- use a new version of jquery.
