- add a new page in the site with word bubbles.
	every word will be connected to similar words
	(words close in edit distance).
- do a favicon for nikuda (the current favicon is the jschess
	favicon I designed)
- turn all scripts to python instead of shell.
	Use attr to get the data i need (passwords, hosts, ports, usernames)
- bring back security in the .attr.conf file.
	This will probably be done by writing python scripts to wrap
	all the ftp and other work that I'm doing.
- we are not really using MySQL as an RDMBS and it is more expensive to handle
	and less scalable than other solutions for data storage in the cloud.
	Maybe we should move to one of those storages?
- google cloud progress:
	- handle the domain via google domain (already sent request)
	- eclipse support is still not there.
- somehow the do_utf_headers var works on marks machine (local install)
	and causes the real site to stop working.
	It is currently enabled for local install and disabled for remote.
- add google analytics to track comings and goings to the site.
- all hebrew string should be taken out of the javascript code
	and then the javascript code should be made ascii again and pass js checks.
- compress the javascript code to make everything run faster.
- make sure that jquery is the compressed version.
- use a new version of jquery.
- diconnect problems in php should give errors and not return the data as part of the code.
- see that these errors are shown to the user.
- make the connect code shared between all the php scripts.
- make the db name and user name be only in one place, easily overridable.
- I want to see errors in communication. at all levels. Log to the console if need be.
- add it so the makefile could dump the database back to a file.
