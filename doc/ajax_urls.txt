This is an analysis of the url issues embedded in ajax scripts in nikuda

If the urls will be absolute (start with /) then we could not deploy the applications
on machines where nikuda is not in the toplevel directory (say https://veltzer.net/nikuda/).

This means the url must be relative.

The urls must be relative AND correct.

This is the tree structure:

.
├── js
│   └── nikuda.js
├── php
│   ├── nikuda_naked.php

the js is running in the context of the php so it is 'in the php folder'.
so the name of the php can just be the php file?
Actually it isnt. Since it is running in the context of the index.php file
which is in the root!
So the names of the files need to be 'php/[file.php]' (relative, not absolute!)
This works well in local deploy.

Lets see how this works (I'm worried about the google cloud for now).
